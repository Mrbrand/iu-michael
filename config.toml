	# List of Google fonts, for use in less files.
	#
	# TIPP! To find fonts:
	# - Go to fonts.google.com.
	# - Select a font, open the selected font at the bottom of the page, maybe customize it
	# - In section "Embed Font" copy the full family value (boldly printed), everything after 'family='.
	# - Add it in quotation marks to the list below.
	#
	# TIPP! A good first step after defining fonts, would be to go to static/less/vitality.less and define the main fonts.
